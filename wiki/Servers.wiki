== Adobe ==

  * [http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/stratus/ Adobe Labs] *Stratus* (not available anymore)
  * Adobe Media Server 4 (only RTMFP v1, no groups)
  * Adobe Media Server 5 (only RTMFP v1, no groups)
  * [http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/cirrus/ Adobe Labs] *Cirrus* (current)
    * also referred as *Cirrus 2*
    * [http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=cirrus Sign up for a Cirrus developer key]

As of today none of the commercial Adobe servers allow to use RTMFP groups<br>
which allow swarming and multicast.

Cirrus 2 does allow that
<pre>
Cirrus is a hosted peer introduction service that facilitates establishing communication
between Flash Player clients or Adobe AIR endpoints using RTMFP. Flash Player endpoints
must stay connected to the server during the entire time of communications.
Unlike Flash Media Server, Cirrus does not stream video or support media relay,
shared objects, or scripting. Cirrus is being made available as a beta service through
Adobe Labs to allow our developer community to begin building applications using RTMFP.
</pre>
but with few gotcha
  * need a developer key
  * can not be used for commercial applications
  * is considered a free beta service

and somewhere in the FAQ
<pre>
There is no commercial offering today with the new RTMFP Groups technology.
