#summary Everything you need to know about the circulate API.

== Design Notes ==

our main package will use *library.circulate*

we plan to support only the Flash Player and AIR client<br>
(maybe a redtamarin command line client later)

we want to be "cross-platform" in the sens that if it can work under Linux<br>
then we will make our best effort to keep it compatible for Linux runtimes<br>
(eg. AIR 2.6, projector with a standalone player 11.2, and Flash Player 11.6 for the browser)<br>
this could involve special "hooks" like conditional compilation etc.


It should be possible to have more than one Network running in parallel,<br>
but it is not high in the priorities of the API.

It have to be possible to have numerous Nodes running in parallel.

We need to define different types of Nodes for specialised uses:
  * sending/receiving commands
  * sharing files
  * interactive (real-time, no latency) connections
  * broadcast (some latency) connections

We need to define different types of Commands,<br>
and define a default mechanism to transfer those commands<br>
and serialize/deserialize them.




== Vocabulary ==

*Network*:<br>
is responsible for creating, connecting and managing Nodes and Clients.<br>
Can be associated with only one !NetConnection.<br>


*Node*:<br>
act as a super !NetGroup (or a "super group")<br>
but contains different objects and references.<br>
The Node is responsible to make all those different<br>
objects work with each other: !NetGroup, !GroupSpecifier, Clients, etc.
Can be associated with only one Network.<br>
Can be associated with only one !NetGroup or one !NetStream.<br>


*Client*:<br>



*Command*:<br>


*Packet*:<br>


*Ring*: (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Ring wikipedia]<br>
<pre>
A network topology that is set up in a circular fashion in which data travels around the
ring in one direction and each device on the right acts as a repeater to keep the signal
strong as it travels. Each device incorporates a receiver for the incoming signal and a
transmitter to send the data on to the next device in the ring. The network is dependent
on the ability of the signal to travel around the ring. When a device sends data, it must
travel through each device on the ring until it reaches its destination. Every node is a
critical link.
