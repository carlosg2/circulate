#summary Real Time Media Flow Protocol.

== Introduction ==

from [ wikipedia]
{{{
The *Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol* (RTMFP) is
a proprietary protocol suite developed by Adobe Systems
for encrypted, efficient multimedia delivery through both
client-server and peer-to-peer models over the Internet.

{{{
The Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP) is a communication protocol from Adobe
that enables direct end user to end user peering communication between multiple
instances of the Adobe® Flash® Player client and applications built using the Adobe AIR® framework
for the delivery of rich, live, real-time communication.

{{{
RTMFP is built on User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
RTMP is built on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
UDP provides lower latency than TCP.
It also enables end-to-end peering—that is, direct data transmission between two clients.
}}}
{{{
Although RTMFP is often used for peer-assisted networking applications,
you can use RTMFP in unicast, broadcast, and multi-point publishing applications as well.

== Features ==
  * *NAT/firewall traversal*
  * *Congestion control and prioritization*
  * *Rapid connection restore:* Connections are reestablished quickly after brief outages, for example, when a wireless network connection experiences a dropout. After reconnection, the connection has full capabilities instantly.
  * *IP address mobility:* Active network sessions are maintained even if a client changes to a new IP address. For example, when a laptop on a wireless network is plugged into a wired connection, the connection will not be interrupted. This is a critical requirement for communication or live solutions.

{{{
RTMFP network traffic is encrypted with a 128-bit cipher.
To play a stream over RTMFP, a client must know the name of the stream and know the peer ID of the publisher.
The peer ID is a 256-bit value associated with the publisher's identity.
The publisher must accept a peer request before a connection is made.
