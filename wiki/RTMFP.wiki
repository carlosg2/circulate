{{{
The Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP) is a communication protocol from Adobe
that enables direct end user to end user peering communication between multiple
instances of the Adobe® Flash® Player client and applications built using the Adobe AIR® framework
for the delivery of rich, live, real-time communication.

== Features ==
  * *Rapid connection restore:* Connections are reestablished quickly after brief outages, for example, when a wireless network connection experiences a dropout. After reconnection, the connection has full capabilities instantly.
  * *IP mobility:* Active network sessions are maintained even if a client changes to a new IP address. For example, when a laptop on a wireless network is plugged into a wired connection, the connection will not be interrupted. This is a critical requirement for communication or live solutions.
